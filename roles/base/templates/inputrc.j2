# Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal bell.
# If set to none, readline never rings the bell. If set to visible,
# readline uses a visible bell if one is available. If set to audible,
# readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.

# completions that is displayed without modification. When set to a value

# possible completions generated by the possible-completions command.
# It may be set to any integer value greater than or equal to zero.
# If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal to the
# value of this variable, the user is asked whether or not he wishes to
# view them; otherwise they are simply listed on the terminal. A negative
# value causes readline to never ask.

# If set to On, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set
# to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing it
# with an escape character (in effect, using escape as the meta prefix).
set convert-meta off

# If set to On, readline will inhibit word completion. Completion characters
# will be inserted into the line as if they had been mapped to self-insert.

# Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings similar to
# emacs or vi. editing-mode can be set to either emacs or vi.

# When set to On, readline will try to enable the application keypad when
# it is called. Some systems need this to enable the arrow keys.

# completion.

# If set to on, the history code attempts to place point at the same location
# on each history line retrieved with previous-history or next-history.

# When set to On, makes readline use a single line for display, scrolling
# the input horizontally on a single screen line when it becomes longer than
# the screen width rather than wrapping to a new line.
set horizontal-scroll-mode off

# If set to On, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not
# clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads), regardless of what the
# terminal claims it can support. The name meta-flag is a synonym for this
# variable.

# been given a value, the characters ESC and C-J will terminate an incremental
# search.

# Set the current readline keymap. The set of legal keymap names is emacs,
# emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-command, and
# vi-insert. vi is equivalent to vi-command; emacs is equivalent to emacs-

# If set to On, readline will display completions with matches sorted
# horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.

# listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a fashion
# similar to show-all-if-ambiguous. If set to on, words which have more than
# one possible completion without any possible partial completion (the possible
# completions don't share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed
# immediately instead of ringing the bell.
set show-all-if-unmodified off

# If set to On, a character denoting a file's type as reported by stat(2) is
